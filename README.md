So this is another downtime project because [Crash's Tracking & Training (formerly known as Crash's Downtime Tracking)](https://github.com/crash1115/5e-training) is no Longer Being Maintained and [Ethck's 5e Downtime Tracking](https://github.com/Ethck/Ethck-s-Downtime-Tracking) is not been updated for a while.

I will try on god time will to "merge" these two modules.

Does your group do a lot of downtime activities? Got a lot of factions? Need a simple quest log or timer? Do you have a hard time keeping track of... well... anything? Then this is the mod for you!

Tracking & Training is a module for the dnd5e system in Foundry VTT that adds a tab to all actor sheets (character and NPC) that lets you add and keep track of just about anything you can keep track of with a number and a progress bar. Finally working on that History proficiency? It's in here. Learning how to use thieves tools? In here. Need to keep track of how much of the town's water supply you've accidentally (I hope) poisoned? Quest progress! Countdown timers! Faction reputation! If you can measure it with a percentage, you can track it with this module.

## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:
1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-downtime-5e/master/src/module.json`
4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button

## NOTE: Difference between [Crash's Tracking & Training (formerly known as Crash's Downtime Tracking)](https://github.com/crash1115/5e-training) and [Ethck's 5e Downtime Tracking](https://github.com/Ethck/Ethck-s-Downtime-Tracking)

[Ethck's 5e Downtime Tracking](https://github.com/Ethck/Ethck-s-Downtime-Tracking) mod focuses more on the implementation of "skill challenge" type downtime activities like the ones you find in xanathar's guide to everything. it lets you construct activities that are made up of multiple rolls, maybe for different skills/abilities/etc that you have to choose between, creating a sort of branching structure with varying dc's for each one. it gives you different outputs depending on how many successes/failures you get and how the activity is configured

[Crash's Tracking & Training (formerly known as Crash's Downtime Tracking)](https://github.com/crash1115/5e-training) mod is more of a general progress tracking tool. it's a little bit more flexible/less specifically scoped and the activities you can create are nowhere near as complex as his, but it's more useful for tracking things that take multiple days/weeks to complete and things that are less "one and done".

## How To Use

## Got Questions? Find a Bug?
Create an issue right here on GitHub. If it's a critical/breaking bug, I'll try to fix it when I can. Feature requests likely won't be worked on unless I can find a use case for them with my groups that use this.
