This is meant to be a troubleshooting / data restoration tool, and there are no checks in place to prevent the importing of unexpected data. Importing unexpected data in this way can break the module for the actor. You use this feature AT YOUR OWN RISK. The developer is happy to help you un-break things if something happens, but she makes no guarantees.",
